## Construction Site Safety Detection
*This repository contains code for training an object detection model on a Construction Site Safety dataset using YOLOv8l. The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and initially loaded onto Google Drive. The training process was conducted in Google Colab, leveraging the dataset connected to the Colab environment.*

## Training Details
*The YOLOv8l model was trained for 50 epochs, yielding successful results in detecting personal equipment on construction sites. The trained model's best.pt file, representing the weights of the model at its best performance, was saved.*

## Model Application
*To apply the trained model, the best.pt file was utilized in object detection scripts written in a PyCharm IDE. These scripts enable live monitoring and control of personal equipment on construction sites.*
